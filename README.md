## BitClover

An application which displays statistics and information for various popular cryptocurrencies.

## Description

My first serious personal project, which combines my two biggest interests: Mobile Development and cryptocurrencies. The application gets data from multiple APIs, push notifications, Tab Navigation, AsyncStorage and makes use of React Context.

### Installing
